A trial work of Attribute-based access control lib


## Introdution


This is a trial project attempting to implement a Attribute-based access control library.

The main design strategy is to use bitmap and flattened tree data to fast calculate authorization.

This project is not accomplished and is based on the flask framework for trial, but is aimed to work independently.
